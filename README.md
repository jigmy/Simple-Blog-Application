demonstrate Git branching

To resolve merge conflicts in Git, identify conflicted files using git status, then manually edit the files to resolve conflicts marked with <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>. After resolving, stage the changes with git add <file-name> and commit using git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict".

Feel free to adapt this dialogue for your discussions with devloper and resolve the conflict easy !
